# x-heep
======================================

`x-heep` (eXtendable Heterogeneous Energy-Efficient Platform) is a `RISC-V` microcontroller described in `SystemVerilog` 
that can be configured to target small and tiny platforms as well as extended to support accelerators.
The cool thing about `x-heep` is that we provide a simple customizable MCU, so CPUs, common peripherals, memories, etc. 
so that you can extend it with your own accelerator without modifying the MCU, but just instantiating it in your design. 
By doing so, you inherit an IP capable of booting RTOS (such as `freeRTOS`) with the whole SW stack, including drivers and `SDK`, 
and you can focus on building your special HW supported by the microcontroller.

`x-heep` supports simulation with Verilator, Questasim, etc, it can be implemented on FPGA, and it supports implementation in Silicon, which is its main (but not only) target. See below for more details.

The block diagram below shows the `x-heep` MCU

# Prerequisite

1. Install [Conda](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-anaconda-ubuntu-18-04-or-20-04) as described in the link, 
and create the Conda enviroment with python 3.8:

```bash
conda update conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment with

```bash
conda activate core-v-mini-mcu
```
2. Install the required Python tools:

```
pip3 install --user -r python-requirements.txt
```

Add '--root user_builds' to set your build foders for the pip packages
and add that folder to the `PATH` variable

3. Install the required apt tools:

```
sudo apt install lcov libelf1 libelf-dev libftdi1-2 libftdi1-dev libncurses5 libssl-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 lsb-release texinfo makeinfo autoconf cmake flex bison libexpat-dev gawk
```

In general, have a look at the [Install required software](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/install_instructions/#system-preparation) section of the OpenTitan documentation.

4. Install the RISC-V Compiler:

```
git clone --branch 2022.01.17 --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/home/yourusername/tools/riscv --with-abi=ilp32 --with-arch=rv32imc --with-cmodel=medlow
make
```

Then, set the `RISCV` env variable as:

```
export RISCV=/home/yourusername/tools/riscv
```

5. Install the Verilator:

```
export VERILATOR_VERSION=4.210

git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator.git
cd verilator
git checkout v$VERILATOR_VERSION

autoconf
./configure --prefix=/home/yourusername/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION
make
make install
```
Then, set the `PATH` env variable to as:

```
export PATH=/home/yourusername/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION/bin:$PATH
```

In general, have a look at the [Install Verilator](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/install_instructions/#verilator) section of the OpenTitan documentation.

If you want to see the vcd waveforms generated by the Verilator simulation, install GTKWAVE:

```
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
sudo apt-get install -y gtkwave
```

## Files are formatted with Verible

We use version v0.0-1824-ga3b5bedf

See: [Install Verible](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/install_instructions/)

To format your RTL code type:

```
make verible
```
## Compilation Flow and Package Manager

We use [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) for all the tools we use.

The `fusesoc` commands are inside the Makefile.

# Adding external IPs

This repository relies on [vendor](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/vendor_hw/) to add new IPs.
In the ./util folder, the vendor.py scripts implements what is describeb above.

# Compiling with Makefile

You can compile the example applications and the platform using the Makefile. Type 'make help' for more information.

## Generate core-v-mini-mcu package

First, you have to generate the SystemVerilog package and C header file of the core-v-mini-mcu:

```
make mcu-gen
```

To change the default cpu type (i.e., cv32e20), the default bus type (i.e., onetoM) type
or the memory size (i.e., number of banks):

```
make mcu-gen CPU=cv32e40p BUS=NtoM MEMORY_BANKS=16
```

The last command generates x-heep with the cv32e40p core, with a parallel bus, and 16 memory banks,
each 32KB, for a total memory of 512KB.

## Compiling Software

Don't forget to set the `RISCV` env variable to the compiler folder (without the `/bin` included).

```
make app-helloworld
```

or for FPGAs,

```
make app-helloworld TARGET=pynq-z2
```


This will create the executable file to be loaded in your target system (ASIC, FPGA, Simulation).

## Simulating

This project supports simulation with Verilator, Synopsys VCS, and Siemens Questasim.

### Compiling for Verilator

To simulate your application with Verilator, first compile the HDL:

```
make verilator-sim
```

then, go to your target system built folder

```
cd ./build/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0/sim-verilator
```

and type to run your compiled software:

```
./Vtestharness +firmware=../../../sw/applications/hello_world/hello_world.hex
```

or to execute all these three steps type:

```
make run-helloworld
```


### Compiling for VCS

To simulate your application with VCS, first compile the HDL:

```
make vcs-sim
```

then, go to your target system built folder

```
cd ./build/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0/sim-vcs
```

and type to run your compiled software:

```
./openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0 +firmware=../../../sw/applications/hello_world/hello_world.hex
```

### Compiling for Questasim

To simulate your application with Questasim, first set the env variable `MODEL_TECH` to your Questasim bin folder, then compile the HDL:

```
make questasim-sim
```

then, go to your target system built folder

```
cd ./build/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0/sim-modelsim/
```

and type to run your compiled software:

```
make run PLUSARGS="c firmware=../../../sw/applications/hello_world/hello_world.hex"
```

You can also use vopt for HDL optimized compilation:

```
make questasim-sim-opt
```

then go to

```
cd ./build/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0/sim_opt-modelsim/
```
and 

```
make run RUN_OPT=1 PLUSARGS="c firmware=../../../sw/applications/hello_world/hello_world.hex"
```

You can also compile with the UPF power domain description as:

```
make questasim-sim-opt-upf FUSESOC_FLAGS="--flag=use_upf"
```

and then execute software as:

```
make run RUN_OPT=1 RUN_UPF=1 PLUSARGS="c firmware=../../../sw/applications/hello_world/hello_world.hex"
```

Questasim version must be >= Questasim 2020.4

### UART DPI

To simulate the UART, we use the LowRISC OpenTitan [UART DPI](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/tree/master/hw/dv/dpi/uartdpi). 
Read how to interact with it in the Section "Interact with the simulated UART" [here](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/getting_started_verilator/).
The output of the UART DPI module is printed in the `uart0.log` file in the simulation folder.

For example, to see the "hello world!" output of the Verilator simulation:

```
cd ./build/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0/sim-verilator
./Vtestharness +firmware=../../../sw/applications/hello_world/hello_world.hex
cat uart0.log
```
## Debug

Follow the [Debug](./Debug.md) guide to debug core-v-mini-mcu.

## Execute From Flash

Follow the [ExecuteFromFlash](./ExecuteFromFlash.md) guide to exxecute code directly from the FLASH with modelsim, FPGA, or ASIC.

## Emulation

This project supports emulation on FPGAs.

### Xilinx Pynq-Z2 Flow


To build and program the bitstream for your FPGA with vivado, type:

```
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2
```

or add the flag `use_bscane_xilinx` to use the native Xilinx scanchain:

```
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2 FUSESOC_FLAGS=--flag=use_bscane_xilinx
```

Only Vivado 2021.2 has been tried.

To program the bitstream, open Vivado,

```
open --> Hardware Manager --> Open Target --> Autoconnect --> Program Device
```

and choose the file `openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0.bit`


To run SW, follow the [Debug](./Debug.md) guide 
to load the binaries with the HS2 cable over JTAG, 
or follow the [ExecuteFromFlash](./ExecuteFromFlash.md) 
guide if you have a FLASH attached to the FPGA.

# ASIC Implementation

This project can be implemented using standard cells based ASIC flow. (work in progress)

## Synthesis with Synopsys Design Compiler

First, you need to provide technology-dependent implementations of some of the cells which require specific instantiation.

Then, please provide a set_libs.tcl and set_constraints.tcl scripts to set link and target libraries, and constraints as the clock.

To generate and run synthesis scripts with DC, execute:

```
make asic
```

This relies on a fork of [edalize](https://github.com/davideschiavone/edalize) that contains templates for Design Compiler.
